🎓 Edulearn – 
High-Performance Learning Management System (LMS)Edulearn is a full-featured, scalable E-learning platform engineered to bridge the gap between instructors and students. It handles everything from secure multi-role authentication and dynamic course creation to optimized media delivery and real-time notifications.🎯 The Problem & My SolutionMost educational tools struggle with media latency and insecure content delivery. I built Edulearn to provide a sub-2-second page load experience while maintaining strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to protect premium educational content.🚀 Technical Core & Features🔐 Multi-Role ArchitectureAdmin/Instructor Dashboard: Complete CRUD suite for course management. Instructors can upload curriculum, track student enrollments, and manage course metadata.Student Experience: A seamless "Enroll & Learn" flow with progress tracking and persistent lesson state.RBAC: Secure route protection ensuring only enrolled students can access specific video/PDF resources.⚡ Performance & Optimization (Resume Highlights)Database Efficiency: Optimized MongoDB schemas and indexing, resulting in a 30% reduction in query response times.Media Pipeline: Integrated Cloudinary SDK with Multer for asynchronous file uploads. This offloaded media processing from the main thread, reducing server storage load by 60%.Global State: Managed complex user sessions and course states using Redux Toolkit, ensuring zero-lag UI updates during navigation.🛡️ Security FirstJWT & Bcrypt: Industry-standard encryption for user credentials and stateless session management.Helmet.js Implementation: Protected the application against XSS, clickjacking, and other common vulnerabilities by strictly configuring HTTP headers.Data Validation: Leveraged a robust validation layer to prevent NoSQL injections and malformed data entries.🛠️ Tech Stack & ToolsLayerTechnologiesFrontendReact.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Framer MotionBackendNode.js, Express.js, RESTful APIsDatabaseMongoDB (NoSQL) with Mongoose ODMCloud/DevOpsCloudinary (Media), Render (Deployment), GitServicesSMTP (Automated Emails), JWT (Auth)🏗️ System ArchitectureFrontend: Single Page Application (SPA) communicating via Axios.API Layer: Express middleware handles authentication and sanitization.Storage: Metadata in MongoDB; heavy assets (Videos/Images) in Cloudinary.⚙️ Quick StartPrerequisites: Node.js (v16+), MongoDB Atlas Account.Clone & Install:Bashgit clone https://github.com/Harsh-Kumar-Mishra2006/Edulearn.git
